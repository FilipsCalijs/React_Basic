# React_basic

in this project I created my first application based on React, in which I learned the basic functions and capabilities of this framework. From this course I learned new concepts and knowledge:

- Elements and components
- Strict Mode and React 18+
- Component properties
- Events in React
- Immutability of state and own events
- React fragments
- Styles in React. Inline Styles
- Class fields and static

The next module will be: React Library. Average fundamental level
